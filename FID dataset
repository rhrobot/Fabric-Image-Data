# Fabric-Image-Data
This a fabric dataset named Fabric Image Data (FID) for textile image classification. The dataset contains 12181 wool fabric images, and all of them are labeled within
four categories. The image size is 420×570, and according to the fabric’s appearance, clothes are divided into four categories: lattice has 3128 pictures, 
pattern has 768, solid has 4169 and stripe has 4116，we hope the open dataset FID will benefit the weaving sector. If you find FID dataset useful in your research,
