# Fabric-Image-Data
This a dataset named FID(Fabric Image Data) for textile image classification. The dataset contains 12181 wool fabric images, and all of them are labeled within four categories.
The image size is  420×570, and due to the fabric’s appearance, clothes are divided into four categories: lattice is 3128 pictures, pattern is 768, solid is 4169 and stripe is 4116，we hope the open dataset FID will benefit for the weaving sector.
