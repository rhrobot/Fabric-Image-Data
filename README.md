This a fabric dataset named **Fabric Image Data (FID)** for textile image classification. The dataset contains 12181 wool fabric images, and all of them are labeled within four categories. The image size is 420×570, and according to the fabric’s appearance, clothes are divided into four categories: **lattice** has 3128 pictures, **pattern** has 768, **solid** has 4169 and **stripe** has 4116，we hope the open dataset FID will benefit the weaving sector.
